# transit-centric-smart-mobility-system

## General info
This repository creates a transit-centric smart mobility system. It consists of three modules: deep learning for demand prediction, robust optimization for operation planning, and reinforcement learning for operation control. The output matrics are (1) travel time, (2) mode share, (3) MEP efficiency, and (4) predictive performance. The goal is to achieve 5% reduction in travel time, 5% increase in transit mode share, 3% increase in MEP, and 8% increase in predictive performance. This repository uses Boston and Chicago as local contexts.

### Three modules
- DL for demand
- RO for transit operation
- RL for control

## Technologies
Project is created with Python 3.7
