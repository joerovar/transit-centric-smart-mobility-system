# transit-centric-smart-mobility-system

## General info
This repository creates a transit-centric smart mobility system. It consists of three modules: deep learning for demand prediction, robust optimization for operation planning, and reinforcement learning for operation control. 

### Three modules
- DL for demand
- RO for transit operation
- RL for control

## Technologies
Project is created with Python 3.7
