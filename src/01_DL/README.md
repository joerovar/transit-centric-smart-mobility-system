## General info
This folder contains the training and testing scripts for our proposed methods and baseline models: VAR, HA, and LSTM

## Training command
change to the current folder and simply run:

```python main_route81_30min.py``` to run the code for our proposed model prediction with 30mins resolutions data

```python main_route81_15min.py``` for 15mins resolution

## Testing and estimation
Please check the notebook *Real_time_prediction_15min.ipnb* and *Real_time_prediction_30min.ipynb*
