## rt_20_e_bound

UPDATE ROUTE 81!

Route 20 CTA

Fall '21 and Spring '22 

Simulation period 5-10 am including warm up/cool time

Study period for trips departing between 7-8:20 (approx) followed until the end 

Modeling of eastbound direction includes stochastic travel times from stop-to-stop and passenger activity

Modeling of westbound direction simplified: stochastic total trip time 

RL method: DDQN 

In separate repo

## rt_20_both_dir

Route 20 CTA

Spring '22 - onwards

Modeling of east/west-bound directions includes stochastic travel times from stop-to-stop and passenger activity

Flexible simulation period

RL method: DDQN/PPO
